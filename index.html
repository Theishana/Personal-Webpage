      applications. Further, I also have the knowledge of cleaning and

      Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. I love using my computer in productive and
      creative ways, I regularly train to develop my skills in programming
      languages like Python, C, Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS and I have helped
      several businesses in my hometown to create MIS systems, web apps,

      I have had the opportunity to work at Asterisk Technology (Merolagani) in
      the Data Analytics Department, where I gained valuable experience in
      managing and analyzing financial data of the Nepalese Stock Exchange with
      the use of a complex data analytics software which fueled my curiosity
      regarding the use of technology in decision making and development.
